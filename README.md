# YouTube API for (Filip) Cisco 

I have made this project for Filip where people can go and see his subscribers, comments and likes he has for his youtube channel. I used React JS and React Hooks for the project. 
You can have a look at the code and see the algorithm i did to make this application work. This is not live on website only repository.
